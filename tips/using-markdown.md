# Using Markdown

If you're creating something that you intend to be human-readable at Github.com, like
our constitution or member list, you're going to want to write it in Markdown.

## What's Markdown?

Markdown is a really simplified *markup language*. HTML is also a markup language.
Markup languages just let you express how you want things to look on a page -- is this text bold? Where's the paragraph breaks? etc.

Markdown is simpler than HTML, though, and great for quickly writing up a document or tipsheet.

## Making a Markdown file

If you want to make a new human-readable document in our repository, give it a name and the .md extension. If it doesn't have the .md extension, it won't show up in a nice readable format on Github.

## Markdown Basics

```

# Title
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
