This is the first repo of Full Stack Journalists, a group of students and
professionals formed at Boston University on February 20, 2018. Our goal is to learn and practice new skills, and create easily-cloned educational materials to help people learn coding skills in j-school, either as a class or in an informal peer-led group setting like ours. Read more about our beginnings here: [Why Full Stack Journalists?](https://lisawilliams.github.io/lisa/tech/2018/02/15/Full-Stack-Journalists.html).

Our goals as a group are:

* To make sure every member has a working development environment, and the basic skills to navigate it
* To build our own skills in the areas where code and journalism intersect
* To work on projects together
* To collaborate with newsrooms on data and code-driven projects.
* To build educational materials that help people learn coding skills tailored to newsroom use, either as part of a class or an informal group. See the syllabus we are building here: [Intro to Coding for Journalists](https://github.com/fullstackjournalists/intro-to-coding-for-journalists). Eventually, we hope to have repositories, exercises, and lessons for each week.

If you would like to join, we hold introductory meetings once a month
which are held at the College of Communications at Boston University,
640 Commonwealth Avenue. 

Our upcoming intro meetings are:

* 3/20/2018 5:30 PM
* 4/21/2018 5:30 PM

If you'd like to come, please let us know by [filling out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfhC6QR9eTbg1G0t2K-DJDVaB5XS2i4PAMpmhyzcZWhq-QbYA/viewform?usp=sf_link),
so we can contact you and let you know where we will be meeting (our meeting
rooms do change from month to month).

If you came to an introductory meeting and had difficulty installing
or using any of the basic tools, here's how to get help. We really want
you to get up and running! You can file an issue. [Here's how](https://github.com/fullstackjournalists/fullstackjournalists/blob/master/how-to-file-an-issue.md).
